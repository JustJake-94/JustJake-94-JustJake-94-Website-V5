        <h4> Episode 6: Sony's 800 dollar paperweight</h4> 
        <p>Sony's recently annouced PS5 Pro
        boasts very little upgrades for its
        insanely high price point. Who was
        this made for? Not anyone that plays
        games that's for sure. Hopefully we
        can figure out what they were thinking
        with this one by the end of the episode.
        *SPOILERS* We don't.
        That and more in today's episode!</p>

        <h4> Episode 5: Nintendo Switch 2 this year?!</h4> 
        <p>Nintendo's highly anticipated follow
            up to their best selling console is 
            aproaching! And perhaps faster than
            expected?! That's right! We got blurry
            pictures and leaked prototypes 
            to discuss! But how many of these are
            legit? Probably one of them. Or maybe
            none. 
            That and more in today's episode!</p>

        <h4> Episode 4: The hilarious downfall of Ubisoft</h4> 
        <p>Ubisoft was one of the biggest and most
            well respected game developers
            out there. But Ooooh how the mighty
            have fallen! All of their recent games
            have been critical and finacial flops!
            And now even investors are beggining
            to question their choice in stocks.
            And when investors are angry that's 
            how you know they are in deep shit!</p>

        <h4> Episode 3: The Concord that just couldn't</h4> 
        <p>Playstation's new big game just released!
            Oh what's that? You didn't know? Nor have
            you bought it? Don't worry, you're not the
            only one! Concord released with a peak
            player count of...700. That's right, only
            700 people in the entire world played it!
            And it cost more than 200 million dollars
            to develop! Who could've seen this coming?</p>

        <h4> Episode 2: Games are so boring these days</h4> 
        <p>Games SUCK now! They've never been
            so boring! I can't even finish most games
            nowadays! A lot of people feel this way.
            But is actually true? Games have never
            played or looked this good. And yet people
            feel like there's something missing. Or
            maybe you're just not looking at the 
            right games! </p>
